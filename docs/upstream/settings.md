# Settings window

**FX Steam Launcher → Settings…** (Cmd+, — also works when the guest has the keyboard). Each field
is labeled “applies now” (takes effect immediately) or “applies on next start” (on the next VM
start). If anything in the second group changes, **Restart VM to apply** appears at the bottom:
the guest shuts down normally via the power button, and the supervisor starts the VM again with the
new values (also available through the **Restart VM** menu item). Command-line flags take precedence
over saved values, but only for that launch: the field displays “overridden by command line
(--cpus 6)”.

| Tab | Applies now | On next start |
|---|---|---|
| General | boot/shutdown overlay; “Still working…” indicator on GPU idle; “When FX Steam Launcher is in the background”: **Mute sound** (on by default: `krun_snd_set_volume(…, mute)` with a gradual ~150 ms fade-out; volume is restored when returning to the window) and **Pause the game** (off by default: the guest agent freezes only the game in focus — `systemctl --user freeze app-steam-app<appid>-*.scope`, cgroup v2; Steam, downloads, and updates continue running; online games may disconnect). While the agent confirms the freeze (`game-frozen`/`game-thawed`), the window is dimmed, with a “Game paused · Click to resume” card and “— paused” in the title; clicking the window resumes the game and is not passed to the guest; crash reports (`--no-crash-reports`, see below); **Check for updates at startup** (on by default, see “Update check”); frame statistics logging (`--perf-stats`) | full screen at startup; **Use the Mac's time zone and clock format** (on by default, see above) |
| Display | guest follows window size; Apple's Metal Performance HUD in the upper-right corner of the window (Ctrl+Cmd+P, View → Show Metal Performance HUD); **MetalFX super resolution** (off by default): Apple's MetalFX spatial upscaler scales the guest picture to the window's pixel size whenever the window has more pixels than the guest (2× on Retina screens, scaled or fullscreen windows) instead of linear / nearest scaling; it runs on the guest frame in the launcher, so it works for every game and the Steam UI | physical size source (auto from display / DPI / mm — `--dpi`, `--display-mm`), refresh rate (`--refresh`), window size (`--display`): standard resolutions from 1280 × 800 (Steam Deck) to 3840 × 2160 (those that do not fit on the display are marked “larger than this screen”; the window is shrunk as before), “Fit to screen” (largest size for the display, recalculated on every launch), or “Custom…” (W × H fields); **Retina resolution** (optional, off by default): the guest display gets the screen's pixel density (window points × the screen's backing scale, taken at boot; the scale is lowered so no side exceeds 4094 px) at the same EDID physical size, so SteamOS scales its UI up to the same size with sharp text — but games draw 4× the pixels and each frame copy is 4× larger; recommended instead: Retina resolution off + MetalFX super resolution (a 2× upscale on Retina screens) |
| Mouse | auto-capture in games; game list (name from `appmanifest_<appid>.acf`, Default/Auto/Off, remove) | — |
| Controller | which physical controller (GameController) drives the virtual pad (first connected or selected), whether SteamOS gets a pad and what it appears as (`--no-gamepad`, `--pad`, see “Controller”), whether a DualSense is passed through as itself, swap A/B and X/Y, stick dead zone, live input test | — |
| Sound | output device (System default follows macOS, or a specific CoreAudio device), volume/mute, Low/Normal/Safe buffer — via `krun_snd_set_*` (looked up with `dlsym`; with an older libkrun the fields are disabled with an explanation) | sound (`--no-sound`) |
| Advanced | — | vCPU (`--cpus`), RAM (`--mem`), SSH enable/disable + port (`--ssh-port`, `--no-ssh`) and generated password, network (`--no-net`), disk image (`--disk`), Create New Disk…, Steam client (`--steam-client`, see “Steam client”), Vulkan driver (`--vulkan-driver`, see “Vulkan driver”) |

**VM RAM and graphics share the Mac's memory.** Automatic VM RAM is half of physical RAM
(4–16 GiB). On every boot the launcher also reserves at least 3 GiB, or a quarter of host RAM,
for macOS, other apps and driver overhead; the remainder is the GPU budget (256 MiB–16 GiB,
rounded down to 256 MiB). For a 16 GiB Mac this is 8 GiB VM + 4 GiB GPU + 4 GiB reserve;
a custom 9 GiB VM leaves 3 GiB for graphics. Settings → Advanced shows both allowances
and warns when custom VM memory leaves less than 2 GiB for graphics or exceeds the total.
Both KosmicKrisp and MoltenVK advertise this budget through Venus's device-local heap and,
when enabled, `VK_EXT_memory_budget`; zink's GL memory queries and DXVK/vkd3d therefore see
the same smaller heap instead of the entire Mac's unified RAM (STEAMAC-S).
`steamac.gpu_mib=` also updates Steam's VRAM-report layer. This guides games' texture budgets;
it is not a hard allocation cap and cannot prevent every OOM if a game ignores it or other
Mac apps consume the reserve. Lower VM RAM or texture settings in that case.
For a throwaway-VM check, `--cmdline '… steamac.gpu_mib=3072'` overrides both host and guest
reporting; `host/virglrenderer/test/memory_budget.c` queries heaps/budgets and fills real GPU
buffers up to the advertised heap (run with `VN_DEBUG=mem_budget` to expose the budget extension;
Venus leaves it disabled by default). Never run the allocation test on the developer's disk.

**More room for games:** free space on the Mac is not automatically free space inside SteamOS.
The home capacity is fixed when a disk is created. **Settings → Advanced → Grow Disk…** increases
it without recreating the disk or deleting games (grow only, up to 4096 GiB). For the running disk,
**Grow and Restart** shuts SteamOS down normally, takes the disk's exclusive lock while the VM is
stopped, enlarges the image, then boots again. SteamOS grows the last home partition with
`systemd-repart`, then its ext4 filesystem with `x-systemd.growfs`, before using it. Other launchers
must be stopped too; suspended VMs still own their disks. APFS / Mac OS Extended consume added space
only as SteamOS writes; exFAT allocates the full added capacity immediately, so growth checks its
free space first. Terminal, with SteamOS stopped:
`work/out/steamac-vm --grow-disk /path/to/steamos.img --home-gib 128`.

For tests: `STEAMAC_DEFAULTS_DOMAIN=<domain>` substitutes the settings domain; `--selftest-settings
--selftest-out DIR` opens the window without a VM and writes a PNG of each tab; `--control-fifo` has
`settings TAB`, `settings-dump PNG`, `set KEY VALUE` (as from the window), `restart`.
