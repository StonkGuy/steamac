### Cursor on the DXMT path

On wmtr, DXMT presents the game as a `CAMetalLayer` inside the VM process on the Mac. That layer is
composited above the guest scanout, so the cursor drawn by the guest compositor is covered. Tracking
starts **off** in each guest agent. The launcher sends `cursor-track 1|0` over `fx.progress` whenever
wmtr layer visibility/attachment changes and resends the current state on progress reconnect or the
guest's startup `cursor-ready` handshake. Repeated enable resends a full cursor snapshot.
1 requires both game focus permitting game layers and an actual attached, visible wmtr
`CAMetalLayer`. Vulkan and Steam/Desktop without that overlay do not need cursor tracking; unknown
host commands remain ignored for old/new host/guest compatibility.

While enabled, the guest agent (`guest/progress-agent/src/cursor.rs`) finds the Xwayland display
whose active window's `WM_CLASS` starts with `steam_app_`; XFixes support and an active game window
are required, with no root-window fallback. It fetches the initial bitmap with
`XFixesGetCursorImage`, then updates it on XFixes cursor-change
events rather than periodically polling images; `QueryPointer` samples position at most 60 Hz,
only while needed. It sends only changes: `cursor 0|1`,
`cursor-image <w> <h> <xhot> <yhot> <base64 BGRA>`, and
`cursor-pos <x> <y> <win_w> <win_h>`. The position and size are in the focused game's X window
client pixels, not the X root: a windowed game's root can be larger than its client area. A 1×1 or
fully transparent cursor is hidden, as Wine uses for a game without a cursor.

The launcher parses these in `Progress.swift` and forwards them through `Window.swift` to `VMView` in
`Presenter.swift`, which owns a transparent `CALayer` named `steamac.cursor-overlay` at `zPosition`
1000. It is shown only while a game layer is visible and the guest cursor is visible and its position
is known; it is excluded from the game-layer and Metal HUD policies and re-attached if wmtr removes
sublayers. The bitmap becomes a premultiplied-first `CGImage`. Before mapping into the view, the
bitmap and hotspot are scaled like gamescope's `--cursor-scale-height 720`: for game-window height H,
the desired size is `clamp(36 * floor(H / 720), 36, 256)` pixels. This includes gamescope's square
downsize when either bitmap dimension exceeds the desired size, with integer-truncated hotspot
coordinates; otherwise its uniform scale is at least 1, based on desired size / bitmap height.
The layer maps the X window position into the active remoted game layer's displayed drawable
rectangle (`drawableSize` aspect-fit into the layer, the same geometry wmtr gives that layer), not
into the guest picture, so a game layer whose size or aspect differs from the guest scanout does
not shift the cursor. The compositor does the final view scaling and alpha blending.

Visibility follows the **game's own cursor**, not gamescope's 3-second idle autohide. The existing
Mac cursor policy is unchanged: auto mode hides it over the picture, and capture hides it while
grabbed; tablet mode and uncaptured `--mouse capture` can show both the Mac cursor and the guest
overlay. Captured mouse-look does not by itself hide a cursor the game still reports as visible.

MoltenVK also fixes fragment helpers that discard from an otherwise empty SPIR-V block
(STEAMAC-1Q). `host/moltenvk/repro/msl_helpers.c` checks both direct and nested helpers:
discarded pixels stay clear and do not write storage buffers; surviving pixels render normally.
It renames user-defined `log10(float)` helpers to avoid Metal's builtin overload (STEAMAC-1R);
the same repro reads back the compute helper's results, not just successful pipeline creation.

`vkCmdBindDescriptorSets` with a `VK_NULL_HANDLE` among the sets (legal with graphics pipeline
libraries) no longer crashes the VM when the command buffer is submitted (Counter-Strike 2 binds
five sets with the fourth null, STEAMAC-25): as on RADV, a null set binds nothing and takes no
dynamic offsets (`repro/invalid_usage.c`).

A fragment output of another numeric type than its color attachment (a Left 4 Dead 2 pipeline from
DXVK writes an unsigned output to an `R32_SINT` attachment, STEAMAC-2C; Vulkan leaves the values
undefined) failed in Metal, and the pipeline's draws were skipped; it is now declared with the
attachment's type and its bits are written (`repro/frag_output.c`).

A vertex shader input without a vertex attribute in its pipeline (an SCS Truck Simulator shader reads
`in_var_NORMAL` at location 1, which the pipeline does not describe, STEAMAC-2Y; Vulkan leaves the
values undefined) failed in Metal ("missing from the vertex descriptor"), and the pipeline's draws were
skipped; such inputs now read zeros (`repro/vertex_input.c`).

An integer vertex shader input fed by a float vertex format (BLUE REFLECTION: Second Light reads
`BLENDINDICES1` as `int4` from a `Float3`/`Float4` attribute, STEAMAC-3N) failed in Metal ("cannot be
read using MTLAttributeFormatFloat3"), and characters were invisible; the attribute is now fetched in
a format-compatible type and its bits are reinterpreted (`repro/vertex_input.c`). Robust sampling
through a helper function with an immutable YCbCr sampler no longer fails to compile
(`is_null_texture`, STEAMAC-3W; `repro/texture_helpers.c`). A texel buffer view of a format Metal has
no pixel format for fails with `VK_ERROR_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED` instead of aborting the VM process
(Uncharted, STEAMAC-3Q; `repro/texel_buffer.c`). A failed graphics pipeline logs each stage's entry
point, shader hash and reflected interface, for link failures and compiler errors that carry no MSL.

The SteamOS root filesystem is not modified: all changes come from initramfs and the layer. Thus
official Valve updates (RAUC + atomupd) install into the other slot and roll back normally — verified
with the 20260922 → 20260928 update and rollback.

The layer's Venus ICDs link only sonames that SteamOS updates keep (`guest/mesa/container/verify.sh`
`check_stable_needed`); they do not use libdisplay-info. SteamOS 0.6.0 (preview channel, 20261020)
replaced `libdisplay-info.so.1` with `.so.3`: the 1.9.7 ICD no longer loaded, gamescope found no Vulkan
device and the VM stayed at “Starting Steam client” (STEAMAC-72). Verified with the stable → preview
update to 20261020 (0.6.0): Steam starts on the updated slot.
